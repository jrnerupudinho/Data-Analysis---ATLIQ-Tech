3. Executed the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process.
4. Developed measures to address specific needs and integrated them into Tableau for enhanced visual analytics.
5. Addressed currency discrepancies in transactional data by implementing a standardized currency conversion process.
6. Ensured data integrity through rigorous data validation techniques.
7.  Advanced in data modeling and visualization, optimizing the representation of complex data sets.
