## Problem statement

AtliQ Hardware, a prominent provider of computer hardware and peripherals with multiple branches across India, is currently facing challenges in business performance analysis. The Sales Director is encountering difficulties in comprehending the company's operational hurdles, particularly as sales figures have been unexpectedly declining.

4. Developed measures to address specific needs and integrated them into Power BI for enhanced visual analytics.
5. Addressed currency discrepancies in transactional data by implementing a standardized currency conversion process.
6. Ensured data integrity through rigorous data validation techniques.
